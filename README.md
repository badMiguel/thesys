# Thesys

This is a school project. It provides a seamless thesis management system for
CDU students, supervisors, and unit coordinators. The group used a combination
of HTML and CSS for the frontend of the website, and Python's **Django** to
handle the backend.

> [!NOTE]
> The demo is fully static — all data runs in memory, and CRUD/account
> functionalities have been removed. It is intended for showcasing the
> interface only.
